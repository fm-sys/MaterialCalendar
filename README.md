The (hopefully) most beautiful FOSS calendar app for Android you've ever seen.

---

This app is a fork of [Fossify Calendar](https://github.com/FossifyOrg/Calendar) which is also a fork of [Simple Calendar](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-Calendar). Based on that strong code base, we modified the app with a strong focus on clean design. 

That's what we changed:
- gray out only month date but not events itself of next month in month view
- make "Go to today" action bar position consistent
- use abbreviations instead of single char weekday identifiers
- round event corners consistently and add proper text padding
- changed some setting defaults as well as color scheme
- hide some fossify specific UI elements
- more compact "today" indicator
- to be continued...
